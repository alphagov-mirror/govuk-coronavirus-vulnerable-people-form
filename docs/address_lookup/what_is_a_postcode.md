# What is a postcode?

Postcodes are made up of 2 sets of alphanumeric characters that describe the area and district (the Outward code) and the sector and unit (the Inward code), commonly separated - for readability - by a space.  An example would be `SW1A 2AA`, let's break this down into it's constituent parts...

  * Outward code - used to identify the correct postal delivery office
    - _Area_: __SW__ one or two alphanumeric characters that sub-divides the country.
    - _District_: __1A__ one or two alphanumeric characters that sub-divide the area.


  * Inward code - used tell the postal delivery office which delivery round the address is on
    - _Sector_: __2__ one numeric character that sub-divides the district.
    - _Unit_: __AA__ two alphanumeric characters that indicate a group of buildings, a number of streets, part of a street or a single delivery point.

This gives a 'theoretical' total of 3,732,480 available postcodes across the United Kingdom.  The actual number of postcodes in daily use is far lower.

You might imagine that once allocated postcodes remain in place indefinitely. This is not however, the case.  On average 2750 new postcodes are created and 2500 postcodes are terminated each month.

With such a high turnover - how are postcodes allocated? Postcodes are allocated quite simply based on the volume of inbound post.  The DVLA for example, has several postcodes - one each for their many departments.

So, my postcode is unique to my home? No. For each postcode there can be an almost unlimited number of delivery points, and an almost unlimited number of non-postal delivery points.  These are generally points of interest to the postal service, but not a location to which it delivers mail. Each non-delivery and delivery point is allocated a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN).  UPRN's are indeed unique to your home.

It is the UPRN for a chosen address that is a key element when adding an address lookup to the vulnerable people service. It is the UPRN that is required to direct food parcels and other assistance to the correct address.
